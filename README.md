# Option-Pricing-Using-Monte-Carlo-Methods
The first purpose of this project is to price a twice exercisable put option using brute force Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo with Variance Reduction, Longstaff-Schwartz and Implicit Finite Difference. We assume the stock follows risk-neutral Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) with 𝑑𝑆=𝑟𝑆𝑑𝑡+ 𝜎𝑆𝑑𝑧 where dz is the increment in the Wiener process, 𝑟=5% and 𝜎=20%. Assume the initial stock price is 𝑆0 = 100. Here the strike price K=105 and the option expires at T=1. The option holder can exercise the option early at T=0.5 or can exercise when the option expires at T=1 like a European option. Thus, the holder of the option must decide whether it is optimal to exercise the option early at T=0.5 or whether to hold onto it until it expires at T=1. Then, lastly, I will price the same option as before using the Longstaff-Schwartz and Implicit Finite Difference schemes, but now the option is exercisable once a week i.e. 52 times instead of just twice.
